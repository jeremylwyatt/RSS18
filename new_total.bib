	Annote = {Review: 

In this paper the authors work on task planning. They reason that the robot should recognize pre-states and post-states of the task to be able to do high-level planning.

The authors use learning by demonstration. Basic actions are learned by moving the robot arm recording the movements. 

Preconditions 
The authors argue that preconditions must be flexible. By making the features independent to each other with relation to the specific action the can vary the possible pre-conditional states. In order to detect  irrelevant conditions they compare feature variance - regarding small variations as an indicator for relevance. The same holds for effects of actions.

The feature variance detection is done by clustering the feature space for a number of clusters, K. For each possible clustering they  sum the intra cluster distances to its mean, and if this value is lower than a specific value for some K then the feature is relevant for the action. To judge if a certain feature fulfills the condition its distance to the mean is calculated and if it is below a threshold then it is considered fulfilled.

	Abstract = {{This paper presents a complete processing chain for decoding intracranial data recorded in the cortex of a monkey and replicates the associated movements on a JACO robotic arm by Kinova. We developed specific modules inside the OpenViBE platform in order to build a Brain-Machine Interface able to read the data, compute the position of the robotic finger and send this position to the robotic arm. More pre- cisely, two client/server protocols have been tested to transfer the finger positions: VRPN and a light protocol based on TCP/IP sockets. According to the requested finger position, the server calls the associ- ated functions of an API by Kinova to move the fin- gers properly. Finally, we monitor the gap between the requested and actual fingers positions. This chain can be generalized to any movement of the arm or wrist.}},

This rule allows an explanation of several visual illusions. We stress the role inductive inference in our theory and conclude with a prcis of unsolved problems},

The approach builds on a 3D perception pipeline to annotate doors and their handles solely from sensed laser data, without any a priori model learning. In particular, we segment the parts of interest using robust geometric estimators and statistical methods applied on geometric and intensity distribution variations in the scan. We present experimental results on a mobile manipulation platform (PR2) intended for indoor manipulation tasks. We validate the approach by generating trajectories that position the robot end-effector in front of door handles and grasp the handle. The robustness of our approach is demonstrated by real world experiments conducted on a large set of doors.</p>},

	Abstract = {<p>In this paper we present a new approach for labeling 3D points with different geometric surface primitives using a novel feature descriptor {\textendash} the Fast Point Feature Histograms, and discriminative graphical models. To build informative and robust 3D feature point representations, our descriptors encode the underlying surface geometry around a point pusing multi-value histograms. This highly dimensional feature space copes well with noisy sensor data and is not dependent on pose or sampling density. By defining classes of 3D geometric surfaces and making use of contextual information using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), our system is able to successfully segment and label 3D point clouds, based on the type of surfaces the points are lying on. We validate and demonstrate the method{\textquoteright}s efficiency by comparing it against similar initiatives as well as present results for table setting datasets acquired in indoor environments.</p>},

	Abstract = {<p>~~ Abstract{\textemdash} In this paper we present a comprehensive per-<br />ception system with applications to mobile manipulation and<br />grasping for personal robotics. Our approach makes use of<br />dense 3D point cloud data acquired using stereo vision cameras<br />by projecting textured light onto the scene. To create models<br />suitable for grasping, we extract the supporting planes and<br />model object clusters with different surface geometric primi-<br />tives. The resultant decoupled primitive point clusters are then<br />reconstructed as smooth triangular mesh surfaces, and their use<br />is validated in grasping experiments using OpenRAVE [1]. To<br />annotate the point cloud data with primitive geometric labels<br />we make use of our previously proposed Fast Point Feature<br />Histograms [2] and probabilistic graphical methods (Condi-<br />tional Random Fields), and obtain a classification accuracy of<br />98.27\% for different object geometries. We show the validity of<br />our approach by analyzing the proposed system for the problem<br />of building object models usable in grasping applications with<br />the PR2 robot.</p>},

	Abstract = {Thinking about intelligent robots involves consideration of how such systems can be enabled to perceive, interpret and act in arbitrary and dynamic environments. While sensor perception and model interpretation focus on the robot's internal representation of the world rather passively, robot grasping capabilities are needed to actively execute tasks, modify scenarios and thereby reach versatile goals. These capabilities should also include the generation of stable grasps to safely handle even objects unknown to the robot. We believe that the key to this ability is not to select a good grasp depending on the identification of an object (e.g. as a cup), but on its shape (e.g. as a composition of shape primitives). In this paper, we envelop given 3D data points into primitive box shapes by a fit-and-split algorithm that is based on an efficient Minimum Volume Bounding Box implementation. Though box shapes are not able to approximate arbitrary data in a precise manner, they give efficient clues for planning grasps on arbitrary objects. We present the algorithm and experiments using the 3D grasping simulator Grasplt!.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the use of independent contact and non-graspable regions to generate the grasp space for 2D and 3D discrete objects. The grasp space is constructed via a sampling method, which provides samples of force-closure or non force-closure grasps, used to compute regions of the graspable or non-graspable space, respectively. The method provides a reliable procedure for an efficient generation of the whole grasp space for n-finger grasps on discrete objects; two examples on 2D objects are provided to illustrate its performance. The approach has several applications in manipulation and regrasping of objects, as it provides a large number of force-closure and non force-closure grasps in a short time.},

	Abstract = {Fast detection of objects in a home or office environment is relevant for robotic service and assistance applications. In this work we present the automatic localization of a wide variety of differently shaped objects scanned with a laser range sensor from one view in a cluttered setting. The daily-life objects are modeled using approximated Superquadrics, which can be obtained from showing the object or another modeling process. Detection is based on a hierarchical RANSAC search to obtain fast detection results and the voting of sorted quality-of-fit criteria. The probabilistic search starts from low resolution and refines hypotheses at increasingly higher resolution levels. Criteria for object shape and the relationship of object parts together with a ranking procedure and a ranked voting process result in a combined ranking of hypothesis using a minimum number of parameters. Experiments from cluttered table top scenes demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach, feasible for real world object localization and robot grasp planning.},

	Abstract = {Many methods for generating and analyzing grasps have been developed in the recent years. They gave insight and comprehension of grasping with robot hands but many of them are rather complicated to implement and of high computational complexity. In this paper we study if the basic quality criterion for grasps, the force-closure property, is in principle easy or difficult to reach. We show that it is not necessary to generate optimal grasps, due to a certain quality measure, for real robot grasping tasks where an average quality grasp is acceptable. We present statistical data that confirm our opinion that a randomized grasp generation algorithm is fast and suitable for the planning of robot grasping tasks.},

representations, extending in a natural way the model of simple to complex cells of Hubel and Wiesel.

Somewhat surprisingly, little quantitative modeling has been done in the last 15 years to explore the

biological feasibility of this class of models to explain higher level visual processing, such as object

recognition. We describe a new hierarchical model that accounts well for this complex...},

	Abstract = {The natural input memory (NIM) model is a new model for recognition memory that operates on natural visual input. A biologically informed perceptual preprocessing method takes local samples (eye fixations) from a natural image and translates these into a feature-vector representation. During recognition, the model compares incoming preprocessed natural input to stored representations. By complementing the recognition memory process with a perceptual front end, the NIM model is able to make predictions about memorability based directly on individual natural stimuli. We demonstrate that the NIM model is able to simulate experimentally obtained similarity ratings and recognition memory for individual stimuli (i.e., face images).},

	Abstract = {We present a method for generic visual categorization. This technique exploits an analogy with learning methods for text categorization based on the simple bag of words approach. Two key novel aspects of this approach are that it handles multiple image categories simultaneously and that it is intrinsically invariant to affine image transformations. Results are presented for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories using Naive Bayes techniques.},

@phdthesis{mason_manipulator_1982,
	Abstract = {The primary goal of this research is to develop theoretical tools for analysis, synthesis, and application of primitive manipulator operations. The primary method is to extend an apply traditional tools of classical mechanics. The results are of such a general nature that they address many different aspects of industrial robotics, including effector and sensor design, planning and programming tools, and design of auxiliary equipment. Some of the manipulator operations studied are: Grasping an object: The object will usually slide and rotate during the period between first contact and prehension; Placing an object: The object may slip slightly in the fingers upon contact with the table as the base aligns with the table; and Pushing: Often the final stage of mating two parts involves pushing one object into the other. In each of these operations the motion of the object is determined partly by the manipulator and partly by frictional forces. Hence the theoretical analysis focuses on the problem of partially constrained motion with friction.},

@inproceedings{moerwald11predicting,
	Abstract = {Visual tracking of an object can provide a powerful source of feedback information during complex robotic manipulation operations, especially those in which there may be uncertainty about which new object pose may result from a planned manipulative action. At the same time, robotic manipulation can provide a challenging environment for visual tracking, with occlusions of the object by other objects or by the robot itself, and sudden changes in object pose that may be accompanied by motion blur. Recursive filtering techniques use motion models for predictor-corrector tracking, but the simple models typically used often fail to adequately predict the complex motions of manipulated objects. We show how statistical machine learning techniques can be used to train sophisticated motion predictors, which incorporate additional information by being conditioned on the planned manipulative action being executed. We then show how these learned predictors can be used to propagate the particles of a particle filter from one predictor-corrector step to the next, enabling a visual tracking algorithm to maintain plausible hypotheses about the location of an object, even during severe occlusion and other difficult conditions. We demonstrate the approach in the context of robotic push manipulation, where a 5-axis robot arm equipped with a rigid finger applies a series of pushes to an object, while it is tracked by a vision algorithm using a single camera.},

@inproceedings{kopicki-etal-icra11,
	Abstract = {We are investigating the problem of predicting how objects behave under manipulative actions. In particular, we wish to predict the workpiece motions which will result from simple pushing manipulations by a single robotic fingertip. Such interactions are themselves fundamental components of multi-fingered grasping and other complex interactions. Physics simulators can be used to do this, but they model many kinds of object interactions poorly, being dependent on detailed scene descriptions and parameters, which in practice are often difficult to tune. Additionally, we have previously investigated ways of learning to predict, by employing density estimation techniques to learn, from many example pushes, a probabilistic mapping between applied pushing motions and resulting workpiece motions. In contrast, this paper presents an alternative approach to prediction, which does not rely on learning but infers the likelihood of possible workpiece motions by using the simple physics principle of minimum energy. This approach is advantageous in situations where insufficient prior knowledge is available for training our learned predictors. In such situations, possible strategies include either training learned predictors on unrealistic simulation data, or making use of the simple physics approach which requires no training. We show that the second of these strategies performs significantly better, and approaches the performance of learned predictors are trained on observations of real object motions.},

	Abstract = {this article we briefly review the
central constructs in combinatorial opti-
mization and in statistical mechanics and
then develop the similarities between the
two fields. We show how the Metropolis
algorithm for approximate numerical
simulation of the behavior of a manybody
system at a finite temperature provides
a natural tool for bringing the techniques
of statistical mechanics to bear on
optimization.
We have applied this point of view to a
number of problems arising in optimal
design of...},
