% 
% Dexterous grasping of novel objects. Learning from demonstration. Data efficiency and grasp transfer. Problem of not knowing whether a grasp is likely to succeed or fail. Note that deep grasping methods predict success from global information, but that they require numbers of training examples infeasible for current dexterous hands. Summarise technical contributions. Summarise overall architecture.
