This section presents a simulation analysis of the evaluative network. After training, it was used to predict grasp outcomes in the test set. This comprised 1,241 scenes with 76,213 grasps. Of these, 40,243 succeeded and 35,970 failed. Our analysis is given in Figure~\ref{fig:predictions}. The sensitivity is 0.84 and the specificity 0.71. The F1-score is 0.802.

% In this context, precision is the fraction of correctly labeled grasps among those predicted to be of a certain class (success or failure). Recall stands for the fraction of relevant grasps that have been identified correctly among all grasps that belong to that class. The results show a high recall rate for successful grasps, and there are relatively more false positives than false negatives. This necessitates pairing our evaluative neural network with a generative model rather than a random grasp generator, which would likely result in very low quality grasps and consequently, more false positives. 

%To test our generative-evaluative learning architecture we compared the grasp it proposes to the grasp proposed by the generative learner alone. Since \citet{kopicki2015ijrr} showed a 77.7\% success rate with the original generative algorithm we generated a new test set that contained both more challenging objects and placed them in challenging poses. The difficulty single-view grasping with a depth camera depends greatly on the pose of the object relative to the camera. The set comprised 40 test objects (Figure~\ref{fig:real-objects}) and another six training objects. The training objects were used by the human to demonstrate ten example grasps (Figure~\ref{fig:generative-training}). The 40 test objects were used to generate 49 object-pose pairs. From the 40 objects, 35 belonged to object classes in the simulation dataset, while the remaining five do not.

  \label{fig:successvsranking}
\end{figure}

We compared the EA ranking to the ranking given by the pure generative model (GM) (Figure~\ref{fig:successvsranking}). This lets us see how well EA re-ranks the grasps. The x-axis shows the GM ranking. The y-axis shows the true success rate calculated as the average success rate over all scenes (1,241 test, 7,311 training). When ranked by the EA, the grasp success probability falls nearly monotonically, as is desirable. On the other hand, the likelihood-based ranking of GM results in many good grasps being low-ranked. 

%A pure generative model architecture (GM) and the generative-evaluative architecture (GEA) were evaluated using a paired trials methodology. Each was presented with the same object-pose combinations. Each architecture generated a ranked list of grasps, and the highest ranked grasp was executed. The highest-ranked grasp based on the predicted success probability of the network is performed on each scene. A grasp was deemed successful if, when lifted for five seconds, the object then remained stable in the hand for a further five seconds before being automatically released. The success rate for GM was 57.1\% and for GEA it was 77.6\%. The successes and failures for each method were recorded and are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:robot-results}. A two-tailed McNemar test, for the difference between success rates for paired comparison data, was performed and the difference between the two algorithms has a $p$-value of 0.0442, and so is statistically significant. A selection of grasps where the two methods performed differently are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:successfail}.
